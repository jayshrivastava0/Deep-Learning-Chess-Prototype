# Deep-Learning-Chess-Prototype
This is a novel approach in accurately predicting winner of chess games. Instead of spawning an entire generation of players, we focus on a single player. We factor in his ELO rating, his opposition as well as the color of the pieces. But most importantly, the form of the player is heavily emphasized as must be in a real-world scenario.
